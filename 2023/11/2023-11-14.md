- Arthur Maccabe and Nicola Ferrier have large, open(?) datasets (somewhere), which may be useful for ICICLE infrastructure design and testings.
- Arthur mentioned interest in creating a data commons for digital agriculture projects.
- I asked question to confirm datasets may be available. 
- Follow-up with both of them via email.
- Tell them about ICICLE and, specifically, some data could be used to stress ARA network between Argonomy Farm and Data Center at Iowa State.
