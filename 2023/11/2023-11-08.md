# Re-syncing the `develop` branch with upstream

*** THIS IS A DRAFT. PLEASE REFER TO THE OFFICIAL SDSC/SPACK DOCUMENTATION ***

There are a number of cases where you will need to fetch changes from 
the `develop` branch of the `spack/spack` upstream repository and then 
re-syncronize a target downstream `develop` branch you are working on. 
To date, this occurs most often when working directly with the 
`sdsc/spack` repository.

When the develop branch of the sdsc/spack repository (or your own public fork of the sdsc/spack repository) needs to be re-synchronized with the spack/spack upstream develop branch, you can fetch and merge all of the recent changes as follows:
