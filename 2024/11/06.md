## Agenda

### 1. Announcements
- Next Meeting: Monday, November 18th, 2024 @ 4 PM PST (7 PM PST)
- Note: I will be at SC24 during the meeting, but plan to make the meeting.
- No update from Ange. I will email her again about whether your volunteer status should be organzied under the MAP program. But I will also include SDSC HR in CC in my next email to her to hopefully get this issue more attention and resolved sooner rather than later.  

### 2. General Updates
- Review last meetings notes and initial taskset; discuss next steps begin formalizing list of key tasks below
- When ready, we will begin testing the ICICLE model commons as part of our work to provide integration testing and feedback. I am waiting on the develop to provide me with an updated Jupyter notebook that provides a worked example of how to interact with the model commons (e.g., upload a model, download a model, update a model, etc). 
- ICICLE is also discussing using the Croissant format for its datasets. https://mlcommons.org/working-groups/data/croissant. We may eventually want to explore its specifics using the SDSC-10 dataset.
