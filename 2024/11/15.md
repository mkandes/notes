                                        umask to 022 on startup, which causes 
                                        new files to have rw-r-r permissions.
  --secure-cookie-key-file arg          If set, overrides the default path of 
                                        the secure-cookie-key file used for 
                                        encrypting cookies.
  --server-data-dir arg (=/var/run/rstudio-server)
                                        Path to the data directory where 
                                        RStudio Server will write run-time

                                        multiple headers.

www:
  --www-address arg (=0.0.0.0)          The network address that RStudio Server
                                        will listen on for incoming 
                                        connections.
  --www-port arg                        The port that RStudio Server will bind 
                                        to while listening for incoming 
                                        connections. If left empty, the port 
                                        will be automatically determined based 
                                        on your SSL settings (443 for SSL, 80 
                                        for no SSL).
  --www-root-path arg (=/)              The path prefix added by a proxy to the
                                        incoming RStudio URL. This setting is 
                                        used so RStudio Server knows what path 
                                        it is being served from. If running 
                                        RStudio Server behind a path-modifying 
                                        proxy, this should be changed to match 
                                        the base RStudio Server URL.
  --www-local-path arg (=www)           The relative path from the RStudio 
                                        installation directory, or absolute 
                                        path where web assets are stored.
  --www-symbol-maps-path arg (=www-symbolmaps)
                                        The relative path from the RStudio 
                                        installation directory, or absolute 
                                        path, where symbol maps are stored.
  --www-use-emulated-stack arg (=0)     Indicates whether or not to use GWT's 
                                        emulated stack.
  --www-thread-pool-size arg (=2)       The size of the threadpool from which 
                                        requests will be serviced. This may be 
                                        increased to enable more concurrency, 
                                        but should only be done if the 
                                        underlying hardware has more than 2 
                                        cores. It is recommended to use a value
                                        that is <= to the number of hardware 
                                        cores, or <= to two times the number of
                                        hardware cores if the hardware utilizes
                                        hyperthreading.
  --www-proxy-localhost arg (=1)        Indicates whether or not to proxy 
                                        requests to localhost ports over the 
                                        main server port. This should generally
                                        be enabled, and is used to proxy HTTP 
                                        traffic within a session that belongs 
                                        to code running within the session 
                                        (e.g. Shiny or Plumber APIs)
  --www-verify-user-agent arg (=1)      Indicates whether or not to verify 
                                        connecting browser user agents to 
                                        ensure they are compatible with RStudio
                                        Server.
  --www-same-site arg                   The value of the 'SameSite' attribute 
                                        on the cookies issued by RStudio 
                                        Server. Accepted values are 'none' or 
                                        'lax'. The value 'none' should be used 
                                        only when RStudio is hosted into an 
                                        iframe. For compatibility with some 
                                        browsers (i.e. Safari 12), duplicate 
                                        cookies will be issued by RStudio 
                                        Server when 'none' is used.
  --www-frame-origin arg (=none)        Specifies the allowed origin for the 
                                        iframe hosting RStudio if iframe 
                                        embedding is enabled.
  --www-enable-origin-check arg (=0)    If enabled, cause RStudio to enforce 
                                        that incoming request origins are from 
                                        the host domain. This can be added for 
                                        additional security. See 
                                        https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/chea

  --www-allow-origin arg                Specifies an additional origin that 
                                        requests are allowed from, even if it 
                                        does not match the host domain. Used if
                                        origin checking is enabled. May be 
                                        specified multiple times for multiple 
                                        origins.
  --session-use-file-storage arg (=1)   Whether to use the file system to store
                                        metadata about the session storage or 
                                        the internal database. Setting this to 
                                        false may require special network 
                                        configuration. See [Session 
                                        Storage](../server_management/session_s

                                        resides.
  --auth-pam-require-password-prompt arg (=1)
                                        Indicates whether or not to require the
                                        "Password: " prompt before sending the 
                                        password via PAM. In most cases, this 
                                        should be enabled. If using a custom 
                                        PAM password prompt, you may need to 
                                        disable this setting if PAM logins do 
                                        not work correctly.
  --auth-pam-requires-priv arg (=1)     Deprecated - will always be true.
  --auth-sign-in-throttle-seconds arg (=5)
                                        The minimum amount of time a user must 
                                        wait before attempting to sign in again
                                        after signing out.
  --auth-revocation-list-dir arg        If set, overrides the path to the 
                                        directory which contains the revocation
                                        list to be used for storing expired 
                                        tokens. As of RStudio Server 1.4, this 
                                        has been moved to database storage, and
                                        so this setting is deprecated, but will
                                        be used to port over any existing 
                                        file-based expired tokens.
  --auth-cookies-force-secure arg (=0)  Indicates whether or not auth cookies 
                                        should be forcefully marked as secure. 
                                        This should be enabled if running an 
                                        SSL terminator in front of RStudio 
                                        Server. Otherwise, cookies will be 
                                        marked secure if SSL is configured.

monitor:
  --monitor-interval-seconds arg (=60)  The interval in seconds at which the 
                                        monitor is probed for new data.
