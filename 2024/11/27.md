# Data Transfer with `swift` command-line utility

- Documentation: https://docs.openstack.org/python-swiftclient/latest/
- May be installed either via `pip` from https://pypi.org/project/python-swiftclient or `conda` from https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-swiftclient
- `conda install -c conda-forge python-swiftclient`
- Jetstream2 documentation insists OpenStack CLI clients MUST be installed via `pip` -- see https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/ui/cli/clients/?h=cli#commonlinux-steps
- To use the `swift` command-line utility on Jetstream2, you also need to setup application credentials for the OpenStack API -- see https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/ui/cli/auth/
- After the creation of application credentials, we find that `python-keystoneclient` is also required since Jetstream2 is utilizing auth v3
- ```
  (swift) mkandes@hardtack:~$ source app-cred-js2-mkandes-icicle-data-transfer-benchmarks-openrc.sh
  (swift) mkandes@hardtack:~$ swift list

  Auth versions 2.0 and 3 require python-keystoneclient, install it or use Auth
  version 1.0 which requires ST_AUTH, ST_USER, and ST_KEY environment
  variables to be set or overridden with -A, -U, or -K.
  (swift) mkandes@hardtack:~$
  ```
- The `python-keystoneclient` may also be installed via `pip` from https://pypi.org/project/python-keystoneclient or `conda` from `https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/python-keystoneclient`
- `conda install -c conda-forge python-keystoneclient`
- ```
  (swift) mkandes@hardtack:~$ swift list
  icicle-private
  icicle-public
  sdsc-private
  sdsc-public
  (swift) mkandes@hardtack:~$
  ```
- Client is now working.
