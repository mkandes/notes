# How to setup and configure training accounts on Expanse

1. Create two `DAILY` reservations for Expanse's `compute` and `gpu` nodes. You can use the 'create-reservations.sh' to do so.
2. Create a list of all training account usernames that should be included in the setup and configuration: `users.txt`
3. Clean up and reset training account `HOME` directories with to their original state using the`reset-home-dirs.sh` script.
4. Check that each user in `users.txt` is associated with the training allocation on Expanse, which is currently `gue998`. Use the `check-allocations.sh` script.
   
   ```
   [mkandes@login02 training-accounts]$ ./check-allocations.sh
   ...
   User train118 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse_gpu.
   User train119 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse.
   User train119 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse_gpu.
   User train120 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse.
   User train120 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse_gpu.
   User train121 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse.
   User train121 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse_gpu.
   User train122 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse.
   User train122 is already associated with the gue998 allocation on expanse_gpu.
   ```
5. Check if the users are already associated with the Slurm QOS' --- `normal-eot` and `gpu-shared-eot` --- that are configureed to support larger numbers of submitting and/or running jobs for a class and/or workshop setting. If a user is not associated with one of these QOS', then the `add-users-to-qos.sh` script will 

   ```
   [mkandes@login02 training-accounts]$ ./add-users-to-qos.sh 
   User etrain61 is already associated with the normal-eot QOS.
   User etrain61 is already associated with the gpu-shared-eot QOS.
   User etrain62 is already associated with the normal-eot QOS.
   User etrain62 is already associated with the gpu-shared-eot QOS.
   User etrain64 is already associated with the normal-eot QOS.
   User etrain64 is already associated with the gpu-shared-eot QOS.
   User etrain65 is already associated with the normal-eot QOS.
   User etrain65 is already associated with the gpu-shared-eot QOS.
   ...
   ```
   
6. Once users are associated with both the allocations and the QOS's, you can add the users to the reservations with the `add-users-to-reservations.sh`

   ```
   [mkandes@login02 training-accounts]$ ./add-users-to-reservations.sh 
   Adding user etrain61 to the si24 reservation ...
   Reservation updated.
   User etrain61 successfully added to the si24 reservation.
   Adding user etrain61 to the si24gpu reservation ...
   Reservation updated.
   User etrain61 successfully added to the si24gpu reservation.
   Adding user etrain62 to the si24 reservation ...
   Reservation updated.
   User etrain62 successfully added to the si24 reservation.
   Adding user etrain62 to the si24gpu reservation ...
...
   ```
