# ARAFest24 Demo Notes

Setting up my own OpenStack networking --- instead of relying on the `ARA_Shared_Net` --- resolved the problem I observed of `ICMP echo reply` being dropped on the retrun from the CN node to the gNB node. Of course, however, this still does not explain the cause of the issue when running the [OTA OAI 5G SA Experiment](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_experiments/araran_experiments/OAI_OTA_Outdoor.html#araran-experiment-oai-outdoor) using the `ARA_Shared_Net`. The new ICICLE network consists of the following OpenStack resources:
- `ICICLE_Shared_Net`
- `ICICLE_Shared_Subnet`
- `ICICLE_Router_0`
