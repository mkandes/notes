# ARA Experiments

### Hello, World Experiment

Let's start again by repeating the [Hello, World Experiment](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_experiments/ara_hello_world.html#hello-world-experiment) at the Agronomy Farm to see if there have been any updates to the list of containers available and/or ability to access its GPUs. 

After login, if you have not already done so, set the **Timezone** that will be used to specify the start and end dates and times for ARA leases. It's best to use your local timezone for specifying these requests.  

navigate to the *Reservations* tab and then click on the *Leases* option. Next, click on the *Create Lease* button.
