# ARA Experiments

### Hello, World Experiment

Let's start again by repeating the ["Hello World!" Experiment](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_experiments/ara_hello_world.html#hello-world-experiment) at the Agronomy Farm to see if there have been any updates to the list of containers available and/or ability to access its GPUs. 

After you login to the [ARA Portal](https://portal.arawireless.org) and have access to the [OpenStack Horizon Dashboad](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest), set the [**Timezone**](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/started_with_ara_portal.html#setting-the-user-time-zone) that you will use to specify the start and end dates and times for ARA leases. It's best to use your local timezone. Unfortuantely, however, the **Timezone** must be reset upon each login from its default [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) setting as your choice of timezone is only stored temporarily within your current broswer session and not in your ARA user account configuration. 

To set the **Timezone**, select *Settings* from the dropdown menu associated with your username and the user icon in the upper right hand side of the dashboard. Once selected, the *User Settings* panel will be displated. Choose  the your local **Timezone** from the dropdown list available and then click the **Save** button to save your change(s).

- **Language**: English (en)
- **Timezone**: UTC -07:00: United States (Los Angeles) Time
- **Items Per Page**: 20
- **Log Lines Per Instance**: 35

Next, navigate to the *Project -> Reservations* tab and click on the *Leases* category.  **create Lease* button on the right. 

After the *Create Lease* popup window is available, start by providing a **Lease Name**. Note that the name cannot contain certain characters. e.g., dashes are prohibited, but underscores are allowed. Next, enter the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the lease. The format to use is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. The maximum lease time for any reservation is up to 5 hours. Note, however, some of the error messages you encounter may be somewhat misleading. e.g., 
```
Error: An error occurred while creating this lease: Reserve time must not be greather than 6 or lesser than 0.
```
If you do not specify a specific **Start Date** and **End Date** for the lease, the default lease time is 2 hours starting immediately (when possible). 

After providing the *General* lease settings, click the **Next** button in the bottom right to move to the *Resources* tab. To run this experiment on the Agronomy Farm's Edge Compute Node, select the *Agronomy Farm* as the **Site** from dropdown list, the *Compute Node* as the **Resource Type**, the *Edge* as the **Device Type**, and then set *000* as the **Device ID**. The list of all available resources can be found in the *Project -> Summary* tab by clicking on *Overview*  option. A similar list is available in the ARA documentation [here](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_technical_manual/ara_resource_specification.html).

Once the lease **Status** becomes *Active*, you may procceed with creating a container. To create the container, select the *Containers* option from the *Project -> Container* tab and then click on the **Create Container** button. At this time, you can only utilize the official container **Image**(s)  published by ARA and made available through [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/arawirelesshub). For the Hello, World Experiment, choose the standarad Ubuntu 22.04 LTS container `arawirelesshub/ara-ubuntu:22.04` as the **Image** and set the **Command** to `/bin/bash` for interactive use.
