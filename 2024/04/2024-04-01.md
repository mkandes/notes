# ARA Experiments

### Hello, World Experiment

Let's start again by repeating the [Hello, World Experiment](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_experiments/ara_hello_world.html#hello-world-experiment) at the Agronomy Farm to see if there have been any updates to the list of containers available and/or ability to access its GPUs. 

After login to the [ARA Portal](https://portal.arawireless.org), [set the **Timezone**](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/started_with_ara_portal.html#setting-the-user-time-zone) that you will use to specify the start and end dates and times for ARA leases. It's best to use your local timezone. And unfortuantely, the **Timezone** must currently be checked and reset on each login as it is stored locally within your broswer session, and not in a central user account configuration database or file for ARA' OpenStack deployment. To set the **Timezone**, select the *Setting* option from the dropdown menu that appears after you click on your username and icon in the upper right hand side of the Horizon GUI. Once you select the your local **Timezone** from the dropdown list, click the *Save* button.

Once the *Timezone* is set, navigate to the *Projects -> Reservations* tab and then click on the *Leases* option. Next, click on the *create Lease* button on the right.
