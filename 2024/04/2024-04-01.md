# ARA Experiments

### Hello, World Experiment

Let's start again by repeating the [Hello, World Experiment](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_experiments/ara_hello_world.html#hello-world-experiment) at the Agronomy Farm to see if there have been any updates to the list of containers available and/or ability to access its GPUs. 

After you login to the [ARA Portal](https://portal.arawireless.org), set the [**Timezone**](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/started_with_ara_portal.html#setting-the-user-time-zone) that you will use to specify the start and end dates and times for ARA leases. It's best to use your local timezone. Unfortuantely, however, the **Timezone** must be reset on each login as it is stored only within your current broswer session, and not in a central user account configuration database or file for ARA' OpenStack deployment. To set the **Timezone**, select the *Setting* option from the dropdown menu that appears after you click on your username and icon in the upper right hand side of ARA Potral's Horizon GUI. Once you select the your local **Timezone** from the dropdown list, click the *Save** button to save your change(s). My *User Settings* are:
- **Language**: English(en)
- **Timezone**: UTC -07:00: United States (Los Angeles) Time
- **Items Per Page**: 20
- **Log Lines Per Instance**: 35

Once the **Timezone** is set, navigate to the *Project -> Reservations* tab and then click on the *Leases* option. Next, click on the **create Lease* button on the right. 

After the *Create Lease* popup window is available, start by providing a **Lease Name**. Note that the name cannot contain certain characters. e.g., dashes are prohibited, but underscores are allowed. Next, enter the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the lease. The format to use is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM. The maximum lease time for any reservation is up to 5 hours. Note, however, some of the error messages you encounter may be somewhat misleading. e.g., 
```
Error: An error occurred while creating this lease: Reserve time must not be greather than 6 or lesser than 0.
```
If you do not specify a specific **Start Date** and **End Date** for the lease, the default lease time is 2 hours starting immediately (when possible). 

After providing the *General* lease settings, click the **Next** button in the bottom right to move to the *Resources* tab. To run this Hello, World Experiment on the Agronomy Farm's Edge Compute Node, select the *Agronomy Farm* as the **Site** from dropdown list, the *Compute Node* as the **Resource Type**, the *Edge* as the **Device Type**, and then set *000* as the **Device ID**. The list of all available resources can be found in the *Project -> Summary* tab by clicking on *Overview*  option. A similar list is available in the ARA documentation [here](https://arawireless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ara_technical_manual/ara_resource_specification.html).

Once the lease **Status** becomes *Active*, you may procceed with creating a container. To create the container, select the *Containers* option from the *Project -> Container* tab and then click on the **Create Container** button. At this time, you can only utilize the official container **Image**(s)  published by ARA and made available through [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/arawirelesshub). For the Hello, World Experiment, choose the standarad Ubuntu 22.04 LTS container `arawirelesshub/ara-ubuntu:22.04` as the **Image** and set the **Command** to `/bin/bash` for interactive use.
