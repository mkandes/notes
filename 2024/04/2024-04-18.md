# Developing a new Spack instance

To begin the development of a new Spack instance that will be merged into one of SDSC's deployment branches, login into the HPC system where the new instance will be developed, tested, and, eventually, deployed.

Welcome to Bright release         9.0

Use the following commands to adjust your environment:

'module avail'            - show available modules
'module add <module>'     - adds a module to your environment for this session
'module initadd <module>' - configure module to be loaded at every login

If you do not have a copy of your personal fork of the sdsc/spack repository on this system, then clone the fork to your HOME directory.

```
[mkandes@login02 ~]$ cd software/spack/
[mkandes@login02 spack]$ ls
releases  repositories
[mkandes@login02 spack]$ cd repositories/
[mkandes@login02 repositories]$ ls
sdsc  spack
[mkandes@login02 repositories]$ mkdir mkandes
[mkandes@login02 repositories]$ cd mkandes/
[mkandes@login02 mkandes]$ git clone https://github.com/mkandes/spack.git

```

Once your fork is cloned, enter the top-level directory of the repository and check that the current default branch in your fork is the deployment branch to which the new instance should be added.

```
[mkandes@login02 mkandes]$ cd spack/
[mkandes@login02 spack]$ git branch
* sdsc-0.17.3
[mkandes@login02 spack]$
```

If it is, then before you proceed make sure to fetch any changes and resync your copy of the deployment branch with the sdsc/spack upstream repository.

Now create a new branch off of the deployment branch where the new Spack instance will be developed and tested prior to submitting it back as a pull request to be merged into the upstream sdsc/spack repository. 

```

  sdsc-0.17.3-gh-124-inst-exp-cpu-dev
