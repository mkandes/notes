    Add intel-tbb@2020.3 % intel@19.1.3.304 to exp/0.17.3/cpu/b
    
    This explicit installation of intel-tbb@2020.3 % intel@19.1.3.304 is to
    satisfy a user request [1]. Note, however, it also appears as if the TBB
    libraries are already included inplicitly within the existing Intel MKL
    variants already deployed on Expanse.

    fftw@3.3.10 % gcc@10.2.0 +mpi +openmp failed builds
    
    Unfortauntely, I have not been able to resolve this issue yet. It's a
    bit odd that enabling +openmp causes the package build to fail when we
    already have successful builds with +mpi ~openmp. We will need to
    investigate this further in the future. For the time being, I will
    invetigate alternative compiler, MPI, and FFTW options for QE.

Author: Marty Kandes <mkandes@sdsc.edu>
Date:   Sat Aug 17 07:19:07 2024 -0700

    Add fftw@3.3.10 % gcc@10.2.0 +openmp to exp/0.17.3/cpu/b
    
    Adding +openmp-enabled FFTW3 libraries to the production instances in an
    attempt to satisfy a requirement for the latest versions of Quantum
    Espresso, which appears to require a multithreaded FFTW-compatible
    libary.  For example, this is the build error I'm currently running into
    at the moment [1]. This is to resolve this ticket [2]. Unfortuantely, it
    appears there is another issue with the fftw@3.3.10 build process when
    enabling both +openmp and +mpi [3], at least with openmpi@4.1.3. I will
    attempt to retry the +openmp deployment with mvapich2@2.3.7 next.
