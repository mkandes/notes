# Upgrade to a new version of Spack

### Create a new deployment branch
A new deployment branch must be created as the first step in any upgrade to a new version of Spack. 
However, before you create the new deployment branch, there are two things to check. First, check whether or not the [head](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#def_head) of the [`develop`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack/tree/develop) branch in the [`sdsc/spack`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack) repository is ahead of or behind the 


resynchronize the [`develop`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack/tree/develop) branch of the [`sdsc/spack`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack) fork with the [`develop`](https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/develop) branch of the [`spack/spack`](https://github.com/spack/spack) upstream repository.
