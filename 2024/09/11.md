# Upgrade to a new version of Spack

### Create a new deployment branch
A new deployment branch must be created as the first step in any upgrade to a new version of Spack. However, before you create the
new deployment branch, you must check whether or not the head of the `develop` branch in the `sdsc/spack` repository is ahead of or 
behind the commit of the release version you have targeted for the upgrade. If it is ahead of the release commit, then you should 
also find the release version number listed as a tag in the `sdsc/spack` repository. If you do not find the release tag, then the head of
the `develop` branch is likely behind the commit of target release version for the upgrade. In this case, you must first resynchronize 
the `develop`  branch of the `sdsc/spack` repository with the `develop` branch of the `spack/spack` upstream repository, including the
latest tags.
