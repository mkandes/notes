# Upgrade to a new version of Spack

### Create a new deployment branch
A new deployment branch must be created as the first step in any upgrade to a new version of Spack. However, before you create the
new deployment branch, check whether or not the head of the `develop` branch in the `sdsc/spack` repo is ahead of or behind the 
commit of the release version you have targeted for the upgrade. If it is ahead of the release commit, then you should also find its version number tag listed in the `sdsc/spack` repo. 

resynchronize the [`develop`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack/tree/develop) branch of the [`sdsc/spack`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack) fork with the [`develop`](https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/develop) branch of the [`spack/spack`](https://github.com/spack/spack) upstream repository.
