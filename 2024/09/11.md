# Upgrading to a new version of Spack

### Create a new deployment trunk

A new deployment trunk must be created to upgrade to a new version of Spack. To create the new trunk, you must first resynchronize the [`develop`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack/tree/develop) branch of the [`sdsc/spack`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack) fork with the [`develop`](https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/develop) branch of the [`spack/spack`](https://github.com/spack/spack) upstream repository.
