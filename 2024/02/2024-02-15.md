# [COMPLECS: HPC Security and Getting Help](https://sdsc.edu/event_items/202402-HPC-Security-and-Getting-Help.html)
- Maybe too much material about interacting with Slurm, lmod, etc for a new user to comprehend how they fit into each senario
- Not enough detail about how to work through a specific example problem, then contact user support with all the information that is necessary
- Slurm centric examples
- Maybe reduce to 2 common example problem end users contact us about and then walk through each example
- Maybe not enough emphasis on how and when to user search engine, when to contact software developers, contact community forum, contact HPC user support.
- Were the headline statistics on the ACCESS slide acuate? Were they only for Expanse? 
- Should security come first, before getting help?
- Why is the login problem used as a senario in the security section?
- Again, maybe too much discusssion about specific problems ACCESS users have, not general security issues with login
