# REHS Meeting Notes

The `create_pretraining_data.py` script included in the Tensorflow-based reference implementation of the MLPerf Training Benchmark for Natural Language Processing was [last updated in Feburary 2020](https://github.com/mlcommons/training/commits/2b2caf7f8ed5474b68a2b4965c49e152a716b7be/language_model/tensorflow/bert/create_pretraining_data.py?browsing_rename_history=true&new_path=language_model/tensorflow/bert/cleanup_scripts/create_pretraining_data.py&original_branch=master).
At that time, the most recent official releases of Tensorflow were:
- [Tensorflow v2.0.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- [Tensorflow v1.15.2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.15.2)
Both of these TensorFlow versions were released in January 2020. As such, we should not expect the MLPerf reference implementation to be compatible with the latest versions of TensorFlow.
