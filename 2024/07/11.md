# REHS Meeting Notes

### What version of TensorFlow do we need to successfully run the MLPerf reference implementation of the training benchmark?

The [`create_pretraining_data.py`](https://github.com/mlcommons/training/blob/master/language_model/tensorflow/bert/cleanup_scripts/create_pretraining_data.py) script included in the TensorFlow-based reference implementation of the MLPerf Training Benchmark for Natural Language Processing was [last updated in Feburary 2020](https://github.com/mlcommons/training/commits/2b2caf7f8ed5474b68a2b4965c49e152a716b7be/language_model/tensorflow/bert/create_pretraining_data.py?browsing_rename_history=true&new_path=language_model/tensorflow/bert/cleanup_scripts/create_pretraining_data.py&original_branch=master).
At that time, the most recent official releases of TensorFlow were:
- [Tensorflow v2.0.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- [Tensorflow v1.15.2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.15.2)

Both of these TensorFlow versions were released in January 2020. As such, we should not expect the MLPerf reference implementation to be compatible with the latest versions of TensorFlow.

Similarly, the [last significant code change to the reference implemnetation appears to have occured in May 2021](https://github.com/mlcommons/training/commit/2b2caf7f8ed5474b68a2b4965c49e152a716b7be). At that time, the most recent official releases of TensorFlow were:
- [TensorFlow v2.5.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.5.0)
- [TensorFlow v2.4.1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.4.1)
- [TensorFlow v2.3.2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.2)
- [TensorFlow v2.2.2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.2.2)
- [TensorFlow v2.1.3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.1.3)
- [TensorFlow v2.0.4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.0.4)
- [TensorFlow v1.15.5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v1.15.5)

These versions of TensorFlow were released between January 2021 and May 2021. We expect that the MLPerf reference implementation should be compatible with at least one of these versions of TensorFlow. 

Another place we can look for guidance on this question is within the MLPerf training benchmark results reported by the community at the time. For example, the final [`training_results_v1.0`](https://github.com/mlcommons/training_results_v1.0) were released in [June 2021](https://github.com/mlcommons/training_results_v1.0/commits/master). Some examples of TensorFlow versions used in these results include:
- TensorFlow v2.2.2 by HabanaLabs
- [TensorFlow v2.4.0 (and/or TensorFlow v1.15.5) by Dell](https://github.com/mlcommons/training_results_v1.0/blob/master/Dell/benchmarks/bert/implementations/pytorch/Dockerfile)
