# Use galyleo to startup a JupyterLab session on Expanse

Let's create a JupyterLab session for Tensorflow development using a [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) 
[environment.yaml file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file), which you can 
[edit manually as needed](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually) as your development environment evolves. 

For additional information, you can find the current documentation for galyleo available within its [README.md](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo/blob/master/README.md).
