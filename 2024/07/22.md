# REHS Meeting Notes

Initial queries about software module usage on Expanse:

1. How often (or frequent) are the different Spack instances being used? i.e., how often are these module names loaded?
   - cpu/0.17.3b
   - gpu/0.17.3b
   - cpu/0.15.4
   - gpu/0.15.4
     
2. How many unique users were using software module environment on Expanse?

3. What are the top-10 most popular software modules from the different Spack instances currently deployed on Expanse?
   You likely need to use the SPACK_ROOT variables here to help delinate which Spack instance a software module is located. 
   - SPACK_ROOT=/cm/shared/apps/spack/0.17.3/cpu/b
   - SPACK_ROOT=/cm/shared/apps/spack/0.17.3/gpu/b
   - SPACK_ROOT=/cm/shared/apps/spack/cpu
   - SPACK_ROOT=/cm/shared/apps/spack/gpu

4. How many Singularity users are there on Expanse? e.g., see module name 'singularitypro'.
