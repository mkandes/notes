# REHS Meeting Notes

### Software Module Usage on Expanse

What are the first queries we want to run against the moduleUsage log data?

1. Which Spack instance module is used most frequently?
   - cpu/0.17.3b
   - gpu/0.17.3b
   - cpu/0.15.4
   - gpu/0.15.4

2. How many unique users are using the Spack instances? i.e, If any of the Spack modules above are loaded, how many unique users are there?

3. How many unique users never use one of the Spack instance modules?

### Creating a CIFAR-10-like dataset from ImageNet-1K

What CIFAR classes are available in the standard 1000 synets? Here is are a few lists of the WordNet ID labels for ImageNet-1K:
- https://gist.github.com/fnielsen/4a5c94eaa6dcdf29b7a62d886f540372
- https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/
- https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a

The original CIFAR-10 classess covered by the WordNet IDs for the Imagenet-1K images appear to be:

- [x] Airplane
- [x] Automobile
- [x] Bird
- [x] Cat
- [ ] Deer
- [x] Dog
- [x] Frog
- [ ] Horse
- [x] Ship
- [x] Truck

Therefore, we need to replace two classes --- *Deer* and *Horse* --- to construct our new benchmark dataset. Some potential replacement classess could be:

1. **Fish**
2. Reptiles
3. Insects
4. Foods
5. **Instruments**
6. Buildings

The most distinctive subsets available in ImageNet-1k appear to be *Fish* and *Instruments*. Let's start with these two replacement classes and associate the different WordNet sysnets in ImageNet-1K that should be labeled as part of these 10 superclasses in our new dataset.

#### Airplane
