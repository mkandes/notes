# REHS Meeting Notes

### Software Module Usage on Expanse

What are the first queries we want to run against the moduleUsage log data?

1. Which Spack instance is used most frequently?
   - cpu/0.17.3b
   - gpu/0.17.3b
   - cpu/0.15.4
   - gpu/0.15.4

### Creating a CIFAR-10-like dataset from ImageNet-1K

What CIFAR classes are available in the standard 1000 synets? Here is are a few lists of the WordNet ID labels for ImageNet-1K:
- https://gist.github.com/fnielsen/4a5c94eaa6dcdf29b7a62d886f540372
- https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/
- https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a

The original CIFAR-10 classess covered by the WordNet IDs for the Imagenet-1K images appear to be:

- [x] Airplane
- [x] Automobile
- [x] Bird
- [x] Cat
- [ ] Deer
- [x] Dog
- [x] Frog
- [ ] Horse
- [x] Ship
- [x] Truck

Therefore, we need to replace two classes --- *Deer* and *Horse* --- to construct our new benchmark dataset. The potential replacement classess could be:

1. Fish
2. Reptiles
3. Insects
4. Foods
5. Instruments
6. Buildings
