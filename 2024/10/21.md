# REHS/MAP Monday Meeting
Here are two GitHub repos where I am beginning to collect production-ready code for ICICLE benchmarking. One focuses on the software enviornments we build and use, while the other one foucses on the training and inference code itself. 
- https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/nexus
- https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/nucleus

I've also placed a copy of my latest working directory from when I was working on these versions of the training and inference code in late August. 
- /expanse/lustre/scratch/mkandes/temp_project/latest-cnn-training-inference.tar.gz

So, what next?
