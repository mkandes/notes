# REHS Follow-On Project
- First meeting: Thursday, October 10th, 2024 7PM PT / 10PM PT
- When2Meet: Fill out poll to determine a better time to meet up
- Check if we should run follow-on project under MAP program - https://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/map-home/
- Potential follow-on projects:
    - Continue developing image classification training and inference benchmark
        - Training: TensorFlow, PyTorch implementations (defonet model, default model)
        - Inference: TensorFlow, ONNX Runtime implementations --> PyTorch
        - Data augmentation
        - Data packaging -> e.g., tfrecord files versus training on raw image images
        - Model quantization --> what are the effects using lower precision data (and/or model weights); nit-planes of the images --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_plane#:~:text=A%20bit%20plane%20of%20a,uses%20eight%20bits%20per%20pixel
