Be aware that OSDF aggressively caches data based on filenames. If you need make quick changes, please version the files such that the caches will see a "new" filename. If you do not label new data, some caches will serve the old version of the file while other caches will serve the new version. Prevent this type of distribution inconsitency by creating a new filenames and versioning your datasets.
