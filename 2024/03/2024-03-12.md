Reservation leases are sensitive to time when scheduling the resources. Set your local timezone to simplify requests.

This might be a problem: *Please note that ARA portal allows only containers from arawirelesshub DockerHub repository.*

It seems like there may currently be no OpenStack API access to ARA. i.e., it is all Horizon/GUI-driven for provisioning. 

The following note about leases appears to be incorrect: *If you leave the Start Date and End Date blank, the default lease time is considered as 2 hours.* Observe explicit start and end times required to create lease.
