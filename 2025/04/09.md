# Deploying sdsc-0.21.2 on Expanse

At the start of this upgrade, the [`sdsc/spack`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack/) repository is still set to default to the `sdsc-0.17.3` deployment branch. As such, the first step in this upgrade and deployment process will be to change the default branch of the repository to `sdsc-0.21.2`. Here is the link to the GitHub documentation on [how to change the default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch). I will summarize the key steps below.

### Changing the default branch

1. Navigate to the [`sdsc/spack`](https://github.com/sdsc/spack/) repository.
2. Under the repository name, click on the **Settings** tab on the right-hand side of the main navigation bar. If the **Settings** tab is not currently visible due to the size of your browser windwow, then select it from the $\\cdots{}$ dropdown menu, which should also be located on the right-hand side of the main navigation bar.
3. Under the *Default Branch* section, click on the **Switch to another branch** option, which is the second button on the right from the default branch name.
4. Select the new default branch from the dropdown menu: `sdsc-0.21.2`
5. Click **Update**.
6. Read the warning message: *Changing your default branch can have unintended consequences that can affect new pull requests and clones.*
7. Acknowledge the change and click **I understand, update the default branch**.
