# Continue the development of headless VNC containers

Let's now try and separate out noVNC and TigerVNC into separate, but dependent containers. e.g., I think we should be able to also run TigerVNC within a Singularity container and connect the client via SSH like we did directly to the VM and the process should still be exposed on the VM --- albiet now containerized.

```
