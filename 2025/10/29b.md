# Continue development of headless VNC containers

Let's go ahead and reconsider how to run and configure TigerVNC first within a VM (over an SSH connection).

```
mkandes@hardtack:~$ ssh ubuntu@149.165.159.173
The authenticity of host '149.165.159.173 (149.165.159.173)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:0mpy15Y1jLFss+56JyfPJg6jBzzcle39zlG3dIdUVVg.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
