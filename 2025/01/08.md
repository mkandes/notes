- Focus on getting a multi-image input inference option for batch job based workflows.
- Next: How to setup multiple inference jobs with multi-image input. e.g., using Slurm job arrays.
- Next: How to serve the models for inference using HTTP/S requests AND how to do so in a lightweight way. i.e., not using Triton.
