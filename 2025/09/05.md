There is no data in the database. This may be expected if this is a new archive and/or you have not yet setup measurements. If you reached this point, then the basic operations of your archive seem to be functioning. A good next step would be to login to a host running measurements and do the following:
1. Run pscheduler troubleshoot to make sure pScheduler is functioning
2. Run psconfig stats pscheduler to check if pSConfig is configuring pscheduler tests
3. If the measurement host is separate from this archive host, run psarchive troubleshoot --host ARCHIVE_HOSTNAME (replace ARCHIVE_HOSTNAME with the address of this host) from the measurement host
