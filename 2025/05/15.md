# # Notes on COMPLECES: Data Storage and Filesystems

Some questions that came up today at the talk:
- Are we going to cover sticky bits and inheritance? ACLs?
- What is the best way to backup data?
- Why so much varability in the Lustre performance?
- Would Spack cause similar problems to conda on certain filesystems?
- Why would colorization in your SHELL environment be a problem?
