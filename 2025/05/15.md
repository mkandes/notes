# # Notes on COMPLECS: Data Storage and Filesystems

Some questions that came up today at the talk:
- Are we going to cover sticky bits and inheritance? ACLs?
- What is the best way to backup data?
- Why so much varability in the Lustre performance?
- Would Spack cause similar problems to conda on certain filesystems?
- Why would colorization in your SHELL environment be a problem?

Ideas for improvement:
- Get representative I/O data from grafana for different filesystems on Expanse
- Create more detailed schematics about how the different filesystems are served from a compute node
- Get data on RAM disk filesystem
- Create conda install benchmark to demonstrate metadata problem; use as a hands-on exercise
- Explore running strace on different Linux commands to show how interacting with different filesystems may involve different numbers of systems calls; e.g., do you see more calls with colorize on/off?
