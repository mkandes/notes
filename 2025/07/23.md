- Landon: Text to Image using Stable Diffusion XL
  - Datacenter: MLCommons-Python: PyTorch CUDA: Native: Multiple GPUs not showing greater performance. 
- Samhita: Speech to Text using Whisper
  - Datacenter: 
- Rahul: Medical Imaging using 3D U-Net
  - Datacenter: MLCommons-Python: PyTorch: CPU: Native: Try and upgrade to GPU environment and iterate on A100s, then when successful move to V100, then Expanse AMD compute node. 
- Jordan: Question Answering, Math, and Code Generation using Mixtral-8x7B
   - Datacenter: MLCommons-Python: PyTorch: CPU: Has both CPU + GPU environment ready to go; test cases working; need to run full offline test, then server case.
