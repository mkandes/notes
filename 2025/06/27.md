# How to install and run MLCFlow (on Expanse)

Let's use a JupyterLab session on Expanse for our development environment. 
You can launch a JupyterLab session on Exapsne with [galyleo](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo). 
First, you need to put the location of galyleo in your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable.

*Command*:
```
export PATH="/cm/shared/apps/sdsc/galyleo:${PATH}"
```

*Output*:
```
[mkandes@login01 ~]$ export PATH="/cm/shared/apps/sdsc/galyleo:${PATH}"
[mkandes@login01 ~]$ echo $?
0
[mkandes@login01 ~]$
```

Once galyleo is in your PATH, you can run its launch command to create your JupyterLab session. 
For the REHS project this summer, we are targeting Expanse's GPU-accelerated compute nodes for our MLPerf Inference Benchmarks.
As such, we'll start by grabing a JupyterLab session on one of Expanse's gpu-debug nodes. 
But first, we need to define our software environment. 
Use the following conda environment yaml file as your starting point for developing a software environment that is compatible with MLCFlow and your specific MLPerf Inference Benchamrk.

```
name: mlcflow-dev

channels:
  - conda-forge
  - nvidia

dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - pip
  - cudatoolkit=11.8
  - cudnn
```
