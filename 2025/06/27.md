# How to install and run MLCFlow (on Expanse)

Let's use a JupyterLab session on Expanse for our development environment. 
You can launch a JupyterLab session on Exapsne with [galyleo](https://github.com/mkandes/galyleo). 
First, you need to put the location of galyleo in your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable.

*Command*:
```
export PATH="/cm/shared/apps/sdsc/galyleo:${PATH}"
```

*Output*:
```
[mkandes@login01 ~]$ export PATH="/cm/shared/apps/sdsc/galyleo:${PATH}"
[mkandes@login01 ~]$ echo $?
0
[mkandes@login01 ~]$
```
