Ended up not being able to use Dell-specific factory reset application option. The boot screen would hang with a single underscored cursor. I found a few observations of the same issue from other users online. However, there was not a clear, definitive solution to the problem as some reported different methods to resolution. I ended up simply creating usb image to boot and install 24.04.2 LTS from an iso using the Startup Disk Creator app. The complete disk was wiped and installed with an ecrypted ZFS filesystem.

```
mkandes@hardtack:~$ df -Th /
Filesystem               Type  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_ybsehk zfs   1.8T  4.4G  1.8T   1% /
mkandes@hardtack:~$ 
```

Now working on getting the system back into usable form. The first task was to run the Software Updater app and then reboot the system. This also helped resolve some initial input problems. e.g., bluetooth was not enabled on first boot and required a restart. 

On the second boot the Chrome broswer was installed and configured, which also included importing my bookmark backup file. Next, I installed Slack and logged back in to a few different workspaces. How do you leave these workspaces? Probably should drop a few.

Next, Zoom ...

Will wait to run Dropbox overnight later today ...

Next, setting up SSH ... copied backup of `~/.ssh` to `$HOME` directory.

Need to adjust permissions. 

```
mkandes@hardtack:~$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
mkandes@hardtack:~$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
mkandes@hardtack:~$ chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
